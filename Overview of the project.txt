Fruits Identification system using deep neural networks.
We are going to classify hundreds of varieties of fruit just by looking at the images.

ABOUT THE PROJECT

Dealing with Image datasets.
Performing Data Processing and Augmentation as and when required.
Creating and training a Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow 2.0.

ARCHITECTURE used
1. RESNET50
2. INCEPTION V3
3. EFFICIENTNET B3

##### TRAINING APPROACH

Training a large pretrained network on large data set with more classes is a very time consuming activity,and there are very high chances that the models may overfit. 
Now to avoid these issues between our model in two phases. In phase one, we train our whole network for 3 epoch. In this phase, we tune the weight of all the layers of our model. In the next phase, we expect our model to just learn Patterns in the current data.
Training more than four epochs might result in over learning.
In the phase two be freeze all the layers of our model and only train the last layer where we do the classification.
This phase gives more importance to the classification layer, thus making it more accurate.
